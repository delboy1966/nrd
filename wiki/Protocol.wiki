#summary NRD Protocol

= Transfer Protocol =

When a connection is initiated between send_nrd and nrd, depending on the encryption chosen, a HELO message may be sent.

Records are then sent.

There are two types of _record_:
  * END - no more records
  * number - the number of bytes to read in

These are ascii characters with a linefeed.

Once the client has sent an "END", it should expect a response to be sent from the nrd server. This should reply with "DONE\n". At this point, it is confirmed that the data has been received.

If you use _batch_results_, it is guaranteed that the data has not been processed correctly.
